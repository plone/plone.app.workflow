1.1.5 - August 18th, 2008
-------------------------

- Correct UnicodeDecodeError in sharing-view when users or groups with

  non-ascii characters and a unicode-string can't be joined. Fixes 
  http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/7576

1.1.4 - July 24, 2008
---------------------

- Keep the icons for inherited and global roles when updating the sharing
  page after a search. This fixes http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/8313 .
  [wichert]

- Sort the principals in the sharing page. Before they could reorder
  randomly when saving changes.
  [wichert]

- Fix a logic error in sharing page view: role changes would appear to be
  lost when saving a view, while the were really applied. This fixes
  http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/8295 .
  [wichert]


1.1.3 - July 7th, 2008
----------------------

- Modify the inline (kss) search option in the sharing page to only search
  and not update the roles and search. This behaviour was unintuitive and
  possible very very slow.
  [wichert]

- Update the sharing page to do nothing if the new set of roles is the
  same as the current set of roles.
  [wichert]

- Update sharing code to only reindex once instead of twice.
  [wichert]

- Only call reindexObjectSecurity from the sharing tab's update_inherit method
  if the setting actually changed.  This avoids an unnecessary, potentially
  expensive catalog reindex in many cases.
  [davisagli]

- Update the search-result merging code based on the code from PlonePAS 3.6.
  [wichert]

- Handle principals which can not be retrieved. This can occur in LDAP
  environments.
  [wichert]

- Mark the security names as public so they can be imported everywhere
  and register them with Zope on startup so you can manage them via the
  ZMI or a GenericSetup profile.  
  [wichert]


1.1.0 - April 21, 2008
----------------------

- Protect the "sharing" form against CSRF attacks.
  [witsch]


1.0.7 - March 9, 2008
---------------------

- Created fine-grained permissions for delegating sharing page roles in
  order to avoid people with a delegated permission escalating their own
  privileges. This can now be controlled at a high level by the
  "Sharing page: Delegate roles" permission, which controls access to the
  Sharing page machinery, and at an individual roles basis, with 
  permissions like "Sharing page: Delegate Editor role".
  http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/7652

- Stopped people from locking themselves out by disabling the ability
  to edit their own roles.

- Added friendly "Changes saved" message.
  http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/6966

- user_search_results() now searches in login name as well as fullname.
  Fixes http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/6853
  [erikrose]

- Factored up the duplicated logic from user_search_results() and
  group_search_results() to form _principal_search_results().
